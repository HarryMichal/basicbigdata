# An Introduction to Big Data Analytics and Platforms

## Goal and target audiences
This site includes supplement materials for **bachelor students from multiple disciplines** to understand basic concepts, techniques, and technologies in big data analytics and platforms.

Even though we try to remove as much as possible difficult, advanced computer science materials in this subject, this supplement still requires a good background in computer science to understand.  The main content of the lectures (6 hours) is also accompanied with in a set of slides delivered during the lectures. If you want to have deep dive into this subject, we suggest to look at [our master level course for big data platforms at Aalto University](https://version.aalto.fi/gitlab/bigdataplatforms/cs-e4640/).
