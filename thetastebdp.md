# A taste of big data platforms after the introduction

Try to taste what would be a big data platform from a perspective of a student.
- what would be your initial thoughts, e.g., where do you think the easy part, the hard part the unknown part
- which aspects are difficult for you to  digest?
- and what after, what has been changed?
  - which aspects you have thought easy (sweet) turn to be hard (hot)
  - which aspects you did not see but become important?
  - which aspects you have thought boring turn to be  exciting?

Think about a set of viewpoints to illustrate your perception. From your goal to build a real-time big data platform you have some perceptions (tastes), for example:
* about your main role, e.g. developer or provider
* about your technical view, e.g., the technology choices, the sub technical areas (e.g., database, analytics, visualization, scaling)

Before starting to work on a real-life example, can you explain your initial tastes/perceptions, e.g., about your role and your technology choices. After studying the big data platforms:
* which perceptions have not been changed?
* which perceptions have been changed (e.g., change in technology choices)?
* Can you  sum up the changes and tell the lessons learned?

Having set of tastes/perceptions clearly would help to explain the experience better. For example, if you have the perception on the view of the big data platform as an individual system, then later on you realize that the platform is like an ecosystem, the perception has been changed from "software system" to "ecosystem".
